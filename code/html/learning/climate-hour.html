    <p>Once a month we get together with friends to discuss pressing climate issues.
    Climate Hour grew out of our own internal weekly staff climate meetings because
    we thought other people might also enjoy having the chance to ask an expert all
    of the questions about climate change that keep popping up in the news. </p>
    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc ml-8">
      <li>Are carbon credits really effective?</li>
      <li>What is methane?</li>
      <li>Should we push for more nuclear plants?</li>
      <li>What are the latest efforts at negative emissions technologies?</li>
      <li>Is the Biden administration as pro-environment as we think?</li>
      <li>How does racial justice connect to climate?</li>
      <li>What can a regular person do to support carbon sequestration?</li>
    </ul>
