Through the Health portfolio, we help women realize their individual rights to have the number of children they desire, which benefits both their communities and the environment. We support organizations that improve access to holistic sexual and reproductive health care, with a focus on contraception and abortion. Grantees in the Health portfolio are service providers, advocates, and policy makers in the United States and abroad. We are particularly encouraged by the outsized roles that policy and litigation can play to advance these rights, and weâ€™ve witnessed the power of public sector support and funding for these services. In the coming years, we will continue to push for more government adoption, financing, and scaling of effective service delivery models and policies.

> After responding to the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 and extending support to existing partners, we are now exploring some new ways to further link the Family Planning portfolio with Preston-Werner Ventures' other interest areas. We will therefore not be issuing an open call for applications in 2021 but will continue to engage in discussions with current partners and solicit proposals on an invitation-only basis.
