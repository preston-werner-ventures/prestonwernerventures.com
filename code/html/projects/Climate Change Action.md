Actions against climate change must be multiple and strategic, and they cannot be divorced from the communities whose residents will be most affected. At Preston-Werner Ventures we invest in climate change action by weaving together a top-down approach that focuses on human populations and forcing political will, with a bottom-up appreciation for individual entrepreneurship and innovation, activist-led movement-building, and grassroots projects called for and maintained at the community-level. We invest in the Future of Food, including alternative proteins and plant-based diets, as well as earth-friendly food production and food waste treatment processes. We also support carbon sequestration through conservation. We invest in clean energy. Finally, we support litigation efforts, especially related to the meat industry and protected natural environments. All of these efforts are in support of our thesis that we can only save Planet Earth by radically reducing unnecessary and harmful practices of production and consumption.
