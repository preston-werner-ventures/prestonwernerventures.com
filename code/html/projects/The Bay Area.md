In 2019, Tom and Theresa created the Bay Area Fund, a portfolio of grants directed by their household staff. Each staff member may choose to direct $10,000 annually toward local nonprofits. Their choices are not influenced by Tom or Theresa, and this portfolio reflects the family's commitment to redistribution of capital through an approach that has been called feminist philanthropy or collaborative grantmaking. Individuals spread throughout communities ought to be in charge of determining necessary causes and building grantmaking relationships, and in this way more grassroots organizations and more organizations led by those people who may traditionally be outside of networks of power, will receive attention and support.

Occasionally the 128 Collective Foundation or Tom and Theresa Preston-Werner also individually support exceptional causes in the Bay Area.
