# form: climate

Climate change is a multifaceted problem that poses a suite of daunting challenges. First, the vast scale and slow spread of the problem aren't easily internalizable. Second, climate change is a reflection of humanity's inequitable allocation of power and resources, so fighting it necessarily requires significant political and economic realignments. Third, many of the practices and technologies needed for climate security are under-developed.

At 128 Collective, we are developing plans to tackle each of these three issues simultaneously. We support both proven strategies and needed experiments in progressive politics, climate communications, food and agriculture, permanent negative emissions, and restricting fossil fuel supplies. We are a nimble organization with broad climate expertise working to grow the field of climate philanthropy and leverage it to unlock larger public and private investments.
