There are many good projects to invest in that donâ€™t have an immediate financial return on investment, nor do they necessarily qualify as charity. We hypothesize that many such projects ought to exist, and we are supporting them through Hypothesis. We like to build great things and help others build even more great things. Funding for Open Source projects, research grants and patronages, and any wacky seems-like-it-ought-to-exist project is a potential project for Hypothesis.
