Our investments in work stem from the belief that access to work is a fundamental driver of people's well-being. When people's work needs are met, they are more likely to be able to focus on progressive issues, such as mitigating climate change. Therefore, Preston-Werner Ventures is investing at various levels of the work process. We hope to encourage intellectual curiosity and career development, build better tools, demand just wages and safe working conditions, and develop emerging economies.
