The only reasonable thing to do with wealth is put it to work making changes that better
humanity and the planet. Bonus if you can find a way to create a multiplicative effect. This
project invests in the education of potential donors so that more people will put more dollars
to work in positive and productive ways. By leveraging small financial investments into the
education of donors, we can spur many more investments in social, economic, and political
change.
