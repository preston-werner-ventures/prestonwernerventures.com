We believe that the circumstances into which you are born should not determine the life you lead. To this end, at Preston-Werner Ventures, we strive to support people across the globe who struggle to survive amidst the challenges of their location. Moreover, we believe that each of us bears equal potential to impact humanity and our planet. We view all people as connected across the planet; the actions by those on one side of the planet will impact the lives led by those on the opposite side. We invest in voluntary family planning to reduce unmet need for access to birth control. We support humanitarian aid to refugees. We invest in just systems of work and benefits to workers, as well as more efficient means of production. Finally, we support access to affordable housing for all.
