Too often, knowledge and data are siloed inside of specific industries, making it inaccessible
to the public and other professionals. Academics receive funding to conduct pilots to test and
verify their ideas and publish their findings in journals behind paywalls. NGOs, especially
smaller ones, struggle to conduct sophisticated monitoring and evaluation studies to
understand the extent to which they are succeeding in their work. Finally, journalists often
seek to investigate topics about which they have little access to deep or contextualized
knowledge.

What if we could bring these groups together?

Preston-Werner Ventures is beginning a new project, housed at the Bixby Center for Population,
Health, and Sustainability at the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public
Health. This [Center for Collaborative Research](https://i4cr.org)
seeks to connect NGOs who need researchers with
students and professionals who need research sites. Journalists can
[send their queries](mailto:info@i4cr.org)
regarding girls’ and women’s reproductive health, and they will receive quick, up-to-date,
contextualized information and connections to additional sources. Our goal is to break down
silos, and de-duplicate efforts, such that more progress can be made toward understanding how
best to support girls and women worldwide in their healthcare needs and actually acting upon
this knowledge. We need fewer pilots, more knowledge-sharing, and more action.
