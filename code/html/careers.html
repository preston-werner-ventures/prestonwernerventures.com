      The Program Manager for the Preston-Werner Ventures (PWV) Climate Change Action portfolio
      should have a global perspective on the main focus areas: Energy, Future of Food, and
      Conservation. You are interested in exploring leverage points in which PWV funding can make an
      impact (for example, litigation, electing mission-aligned politicians, or angel investing in
      emerging economies), and in understanding how those will vary in high income countries versus
      low and middle income countries.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Weâ€™d like the incoming PM to appreciate the difference between production-fueled and
      consumption-fueled emissions, and be able to identify trade patterns that should influence our
      funding strategies. The successful applicant will demonstrate a holistic understanding of the
      causes and effects of climate change, and be keen to work with other Program Managers to forge
      common strategies, especially around population, health, livelihoods, and other markers of
      human welfare.
