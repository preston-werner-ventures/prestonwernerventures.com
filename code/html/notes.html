          For the past several months Tom, Rob and a couple of other contributors have been building
          a new Javascript framework. Today we're proud to unveil
          <a href="https://redwoodjs.com" class="underline">Redwood</a>, a framework for the next
          phase of the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Redwood is meant to be deployed to the edge—CDNs and Lambda functions that can be
          distributed around the globe and served to users in milliseconds. In tech circles this is
          known as the JAMstack (Javascript, APIs and Markup). Until now the JAMstack has mostly
          focused on static sites being backed by a CMS (Content Management System). Redwood makes
          relational databases a first-class citizen in the JAMstack, allowing your front-end to get
          and send data to a real database through a GraphQL API. This, along with many other
          time-saving and productivity-enhancing features makes Redwood not only a powerful JS
          framework, but it's actually fun to work in, too.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We think Redwood is poised to be a major player in this new world of single page
          applications. Want to help us build it? Join our

          Preston-Werner Ventures is at the beginning. We have just today launched our website, a
          sign to our patient grantees and partners that we are, in fact, a real thing. To nudge us
          forward, I am writing a letter to document where we are today and where we’re hoping to go
          someday soon.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          As a couple, when Tom and I come together, we goad one another to “push harder, and do
          more!” This has become our family motto. On my own, I’ve spent my career working with and
          learning about inequality, political economy, and the monitoring and measurement of human
          activity. Tom has worked ever since I’ve known him (twenty years this February) on gaps in
          technology and how to develop innovative solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Our date nights consist of rapid-fire conversation, pens scribbling across notebooks;
          dinner and desert the afterthought. We make proposals to one another, unafraid to sound
          grandiose, but knowing that the other has veto power. We try to differentiate between
          recognizing a problem we want to solve and the solutions that may or may not solve it.
          It’s like the line attributed to Henry Ford about building a faster horse.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          You must leap with imagination, Tom says to me.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          We also know that we can be limited by the imaginations of the people asking the
          questions. Hence, Preston-Werner Ventures seeks to collaborate with people who know more
          than we do, and this approach will extend to our grantmaking and investing and to our
          support of open-source development. We intend to stand back as the voices of other rise
          up. This is the basis of Preston-Werner Ventures. We want to push projects forward, build
          in the world, and expand the boundaries of what’s possible and accessible for everyone. We
          can’t do it alone. We need more people asking questions, and more people providing
          answers. We’re interested in funding solutions that protect and enhance our world and the
          people in it.
        </p>
