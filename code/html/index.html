    At Preston-Werner Ventures, we are driven by the moral imperatives
    posed by <span class="highlight-word md:whitespace-no-wrap">climate change and inequity</span>.
    We seek not only to prevent their harms, but also to
    <span class="highlight-word md:whitespace-no-wrap">create a society</span> that redirects capital
    to build healthier ecosystems and <span class="highlight-word md:whitespace-no-wrap">flourishing human communities</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8 text-xl md:text-2xl">
    We approach this task with humility but also with urgency. The
    mathematics of climate change make clear that <span class="highlight-word">this decade is our
    last hope</span> to minimize suffering and avoid irreversible tipping points.
    While this timeline can be terrifying, we are inspired by our young
    leaders to view it as an opportunity to hasten our move towards justice.<span class="highlight-word">*</span>
