    <ol class="ml-4 list-decimal mt-4">
      <li class="mt-4">In order to combat the climate crisis more justly and effectively, the redistribution of carbon dioxide must be considered alongside the redistribution of wealth and power.</li>
      <li class="mt-4">Carbon dioxide removal costs should be borne principally by fossil fuel companies, and secondly by wealthy societies with long pollution legacies. Imposing costs on the global majority and future generations must be minimized.</li>
      <li class="mt-4">Carbon dioxide removal must not enable new pollution.</li>
      <li class="mt-4">Carbon dioxide removal strategies to achieve a safe climate (350ppm CO2) must promote just social and economic goals (e.g. democratic ownership, community benefit agreements, intellectual property transfer,etc.) as well as rigorous scientific standards (e.g. additionality, durability, etc).</li>
      <li class="mt-4">Inclusivity and expertise should both be valued in decision making around carbon justice. We must embrace both diversity and complexity.</li>
