      Greetings! I am Claudia Rivas (she/her) and I am Vegetarian Vegan Chef in the Bay Area.
      I have 7 years of professional work experience. I decided to go to the Natural
      Gourmet in New York City because it was one of the best vegetarian schools in
      the country.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Being vegetarian most of my life has felt like the perfect fit for me. I did
      my internship at Ravens Stanford Inn the was immediately hired long term.
      After a couple of years I was offered a position at Greens in the Marina in
      San Francisco and finally realized my dream of living and working in San Francisco.
      I worked my way up through the ranks of various restaurants and catering
      companies throughout the Bay.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I eventually became a private chef and entrepreneur owner of my own catering
      company called Señorita Vegerita. Through my catering company and private
      position I am blessed to be able to focus on plant-based food and no longer
      compromising my values.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I am passionate about teaching people just how delicious food can be when
      it's animal and cruelty free. I am dedicated to uplifting my black and brown
      community in Oakland through food health and nutritional education. I am
      also passionate about supporting female-led black and brown owned businesses.
      I look forward to helping my community grow and thrive.

      among other important qualities, confidence. The ability to have empathy and initiate
      social change is corelated to self-worth. Dahli believes our path to stopping social
      injustice is through radically innovative parenting. She says that power, greed, and
      evil are not innate human qualities, but learned or adopted from childhood trauma.

      many of the groups who helped us along the way so they can continue helping families
