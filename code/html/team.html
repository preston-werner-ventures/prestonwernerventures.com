      Amelia (she/her) joined 128 Collective in 2016; she leads our learning and
      impact efforts. Amelia has a Master of Public Health in Maternal and Child Health
      from UC Berkeley and a BA in International Relations from Brown University. Prior

      international development fields, including Four Women Health Services (Massachusetts),

    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      The initial phase of Amelia's career focused on community-level access to sexual
      and reproductive health information and services globally. Over time, she realized
      that reproductive rights must be achieved alongside economic and racial justice.
      To accomplish that, Amelia believes that we need to meet communities where they are.
      She loves helping organizations plan strategically for the greatest impact and
      systemic change.
