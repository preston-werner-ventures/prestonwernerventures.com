      Theresa wears many hats. Anthropologist. Entrepreneur. Investor. Philanthropist. She has spent
      the past two decades working to understand global poverty and injustice and to support efforts
      on the ground aimed at transforming political, economic, and social systems in order to better
      the lives of individuals.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Theresa received her BA in Anthropology and Gender Studies from Scripps College and her PhD in
      Anthropology from Northwestern University. Her research focused on the development of enclave
      economies throughout Central America and the recent surge of international direct-sales
      companies in their wake. In particular, the work examined how companies are able to manipulate
      vulnerable populations, often poor, uneducated women and young, unskilled men. In the U.S. and
      abroad, Theresa has worked with, advised, and founded various non-profit and for-profit
      organizations in fields ranging from girls and education to women and family planning to youth
      and technology to the tech world and philanthropy.
