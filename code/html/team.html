      abroad, Theresa has worked with, advised, and founded various non-profit and for-profit

      Greetings! I am Claudia Rivas (she/her) and I am Vegetarian Vegan Chef in the Bay Area.
      I have 7 years of professional work experience. I decided to go to the Natural
      Gourmet in New York City because it was one of the best vegetarian schools in
      the country.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Being vegetarian most of my life has felt like the perfect fit for me. I did
      my internship at Ravens Stanford Inn the was immediately hired long term.
      After a couple of years I was offered a position at Greens in the Marina in
      San Francisco and finally realized my dream of living and working in San Francisco.
      I worked my way up through the ranks of various restaurants and catering
      companies throughout the Bay.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I eventually became a private chef and entrepreneur owner of my own catering
      company called Señorita Vegerita. Through my catering company and private
      position I am blessed to be able to focus on plant-based food and no longer
      compromising my values.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I am passionate about teaching people just how delicious food can be when
      it's animal and cruelty free. I am dedicated to uplifting my black and brown
      community in Oakland through food health and nutritional education. I am
      also passionate about supporting female-led black and brown owned businesses.
      I look forward to helping my community grow and thrive.
