# Announcing RedwoodJS
## March 10 2020
### Rob Cameron

For the past several months Tom, Rob and a couple of other contributors have been building a new Javascript framework. Today we're proud to unveil [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com) a framework for the next phase of the internet.

Redwood is meant to be deployed to the edgeâ€”CDNs and Lambda functions that can be distributed around the globe and served to users in milliseconds. In tech circles this is known as the JAMstack (Javascript, APIs and Markup). Until now the JAMstack has mostly focused on static sites being backed by a CMS (Content Management System). Redwood makes relational databases a first-class citizen in the JAMstack, allowing your front-end to get and send data to a real database through a GraphQL API. This, along with many other time-saving and productivity-enhancing features makes Redwood not only a powerful JS framework, but it's actually fun to work in, too.

We think Redwood is poised to be a major player in this new world of single page applications. Want to help us build it? Join our [discussion forum](https://community.redwoodjs.com) and open up a [pull request](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pulls)!
