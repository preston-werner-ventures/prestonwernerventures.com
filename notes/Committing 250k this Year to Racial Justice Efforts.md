On February 23rd, Ahmaud Arbery was murdered by armed white men while jogging near Brunswick, Georgia.
On March 13th, Breonna Taylor was murdered by Louisville Metro Police in her own home. On May 25th,
George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police officers. These are just three of the names on the list
of thousands of Black men and women who lost their lives to the systemic racism that is woven into the
fabric of this country.

It will take a monumental anti-racist movement to change the underlying conditions that allow racism
in the United States to flourish. As part of that movement, Preston-Werner Ventures is committing
$250,000 this year to projects that fight systemic racism. Here's how we intend the funds to be dispersed:

$50,000 toward efforts to put an end to police brutality and the criminalization system.

$50,000 to support Black political candidates and candidates who are most likely to push forward
anti-racist policy change.

$50,000 for Black education and business initiatives.

$100,000 to long-term strategic efforts to create jobs and invest in Black communities.

We will issue this financial support over the next few months. When we finalize commitments to specific
projects, we will announce them on here.

This is the first of many steps we will be taking in our formalized approach to funding racial justice
efforts. We look forward to working with Black leaders and community members to dismantle the racist
structures that pervade our society. If you find yourself in a position of privilege, I hope you too
will join the movement with your time, money, and effort.
