RedwoodJS recently won a Jammies award for [Jamstack Product or Service of the Year](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/06/announcing-the-jammies-awards-winners/)!
We were in great company with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/). We couldn't have done it without
our [more than 100 contributors](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood#contributors) who give their time and expertise to help
build Redwood into what it is today.

During the awards everyone had a chance to put together a promotional video for their project. Here are ours:
